Auto-BnB

Auto-BnB was made using two distinct servers - one for the front end and one for the backend.

To Start the website on your local host you will need to
- change directory into the backend folder as well as the frontend folder.
- Create a new psql database for this project with nothing in it
- From the backend folder you will need to create a '.env' file for the credetials to a psql database that you have on your machine.
- run migrate and seed from sequelize inside the backend folder
- run npm start from both the backend and the frontend

After you have completed these steps, you should see the websited being hosted on your local Machine
